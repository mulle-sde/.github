# MulleSDE

MulleSDE is an IDE and a dependency (package) manager for the commandline. There are no graphical components.
Amongst a few other things it

* provides a per-project environment
* fetches remote files and place them anywhere in your project tree
* fetches and builds dependencies (archives and git repositories) *recursively* and installs them locally to the project or at a chose place
* creates source files from templates
* transforms file-system structure into project files
* interfaces with various build systems
* parallelizes cmake project builds
* loads build instructions for third party dependencies from github
* is scriptable and extensible

## Documentation

The [mulle-sde WiKi](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde/wiki) has some introductory and
in-depth information, that doesn't fit into the help texts of the various mulle-sde commands. 
Otherwise mulle-sde strives to be self-explanatory through help texts and file comments.


## Install

See [mulle-sde-developer](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer) how
to install mulle-sde.


## Quick Start

If you want to compile some dependencies without setting up a mulle-sde project,
you can do an *install* with an archive. Here is an example where the latest *mulle-buffer*
and its dependencies is installed into `/tmp/foo`:

``` bash
mulle-sde install --prefix /tmp/foo https://github.com/mulle-c/mulle-buffer/archive/latest.tar.gz
```

If you don't want to use the mulle-sde project management features, but would like to
keep the dependencies local to your project, you can use a `none` project type:

``` bash
mulle-sde init none
mulle-sde dependency add --c --github mulle-c mulle-buffer
mulle-sde craft
mulle-sde linkorder
```

This will create four folders with the compiled results:

```
.
├── dependency   # the desired output
├── kitchen      # temporary build folder
├── .mulle       # internal mulle-sde maintenance
└── stash        # download dependencies
```

and it will give you the link options for your platform in the correct order:

```
-L./dependency/lib
-lmulle-buffer
-lmulle-allocator
```
